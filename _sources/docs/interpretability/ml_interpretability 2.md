# Interpretability of Neural Networks

In particular for applications in science, we not only want to obtain a neural network that excels at performing a given task, but we also seek an understanding how the problem was solved. Ideally, we want to know underlying principles, deduce causal relations, identify abstracted notions. This is the topic of interpretability.
