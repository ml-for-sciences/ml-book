# Kernel PCA

PCA performs a linear transformation on the data. However, there are
cases where such a transformation is unable to produce any meaningful
result. Consider for instance the fictitious dataset with $2$ classes
and $2$ data features as shown on the left of {numref}`fig:Kernel-PCA`. We see by naked eye that it should be
possible to separate this data well, for instance by the distance of the
datapoint from the origin, but it is also clear that a linear function
cannot be used to compute it. In this case, it can be helpful to
consider a non-linear extension of PCA, known as *kernel PCA*.

The basic idea of this method is to apply to the data
$\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ a chosen non-linear vector-valued
transformation function $\mathbf{\Phi}(\mathbf{x})$ with

```{math}
:label: eqn:kernel-pca-transformation
    \mathbf{\Phi}: \mathbb{R}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{N},
```

which is a map from the original $n$-dimensional space (corresponding to the $n$
original data features) to a $N$-dimensional feature space. Kernel PCA
then simply involves performing the standard PCA on the transformed data
$\mathbf{\Phi}(\mathbf{x})$. Here, we will assume that the transformed data is
centered, i.e., 

```{math}
\sum_i \Phi(\mathbf{x}_i) = 0
```

to have simpler formulas.

**Kernel PCA versus PCA.**
```
In practice, when $N$ is large, it is not efficient or even possible to
explicitly perform the transformation $\mathbf{\Phi}$. Instead we can make
use of a method known as the kernel trick. Recall that in standard PCA,
the primary aim is to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the
covariance matrix $C$ . In the case of kernel PCA, this matrix becomes

```{math}
C = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \mathbf{\Phi}(\mathbf{x}_{i})\mathbf{\Phi}(\mathbf{x}_{i})^T,
```

with the eigenvalue equation

```{math}
:label: eqn:pca-eigenvalue-equation
\sum_{i=1}^{m} \mathbf{\Phi}(\mathbf{x}_{i})\mathbf{\Phi}(\mathbf{x}_{i})^T \mathbf{v}_{j} = \lambda_{j}\mathbf{v}_{j}.
```

By writing the eigenvectors $\mathbf{v}_{j}$ as a linear combination of the transformed data features

```{math}
\mathbf{v}_{j} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} a_{ji}\mathbf{\Phi}(\mathbf{x}_{i}),
```

we see that finding the eigenvectors is equivalent to finding the coefficients
$a_{ji}$. On substituting this form back into Eq.Â [](eqn:pca-eigenvalue-equation), we find

```{math}
\sum_{i=1}^{m} \mathbf{\Phi}(\mathbf{x}_{i})\mathbf{\Phi}(\mathbf{x}_{i})^T \left[ \sum_{i=1}^{m} a_{ji}\mathbf{\Phi}(\mathbf{x}_{j}) \right] = \lambda_{j} \left[ \sum_{i=1}^{m} a_{ji}\mathbf{\Phi}(\mathbf{x}_{i}) \right].
```

By multiplying both sides of the equation by $\mathbf{\Phi}(\mathbf{x}_{k})^{T}$
we arrive at 

```{math}
:label: eqn:kernel-pca-eigen-equation}
    \begin{split}
        \sum_{i=1}^{m} \mathbf{\Phi}(\mathbf{x}_{k})^{T} \mathbf{\Phi}(\mathbf{x}_{i})\mathbf{\Phi}(\mathbf{x}_{i})^T \left[ \sum_{l=1}^{m} a_{jl}\mathbf{\Phi}(\mathbf{x}_{l}) \right] &= \lambda_{j} \mathbf{\Phi}(\mathbf{x}_{k})^{T} \left[ \sum_{l=1}^{m} a_{jl} \mathbf{\Phi}(\mathbf{x}_{l}) \right] \\
        \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left[ \mathbf{\Phi}(\mathbf{x}_{k})^{T} \mathbf{\Phi}(\mathbf{x}_{i}) \right]   \sum_{l=1}^{m} a_{jl} \left[ \mathbf{\Phi}(\mathbf{x}_{i})^T \mathbf{\Phi}(\mathbf{x}_{l}) \right] &= \lambda_{j} \sum_{l=1}^{m} a_{jl} \left[ \mathbf{\Phi}(\mathbf{x}_{k})^{T} \mathbf{\Phi}(\mathbf{x}_{l}) \right] \\
        \sum_{i=1}^{m} K(\mathbf{x}_{k},\mathbf{x}_{i})   \sum_{l=1}^{m} a_{jl} K(\mathbf{x}_{i},\mathbf{x}_{l}) &= \lambda_{j} \sum_{l=1}^{m} a_{jl} K(\mathbf{x}_{k},\mathbf{x}_{l}), 
    \end{split}
```

where $K(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) = \mathbf{\Phi}(\mathbf{x})^{T} \mathbf{\Phi}(\mathbf{y})$ is known as
the *kernel*. Thus we see that if we directly specify the kernels we can
avoid explicit performing the transformation $\mathbf{\Phi}$. In matrix
form, we find the eigenvalue equation
$K^{2}\mathbf{a}_{j} = \lambda_{j} K \mathbf{a}_{j}$, which simplifies to

```{math}
K \mathbf{a}_{j} = \lambda_{j} \mathbf{a}_{j}.
```

Note that this simplification requires $\lambda_j \neq 0$, which will be the case for relevant
principle components. (If $\lambda_{j} = 0$, then the corresponding
eigenvectors would be irrelevant components to be discarded.) After
solving the above equation and obtaining the coefficients $a_{jl}$, the
kernel PCA transformation is then simply given by the overlap with the
eigenvectors $\mathbf{v}_{j}$, i.e.,

```{math}
\mathbf{x} \rightarrow \mathbf{\Phi}(\mathbf{x}) \rightarrow y_{j} = \mathbf{v}_{j}^{T}\mathbf{\Phi}(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^{m} a_{ji} \mathbf{\Phi}(\mathbf{x}_{i})^{T} \mathbf{\Phi}(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^{m} a_{ji} K(\mathbf{x}_{i},\mathbf{x}),
```

where once again the explicit $\mathbf{\Phi}$ transformation is avoided.

A common choice for the kernel is known as the radial basis function
kernel (RBF) defined by

```{math}
K_{\textrm{RBF}}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) = \exp\left( -\gamma \| \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}\|^{2} \right),
```

where $\gamma$ is a tunable parameter. Using the RBF kernel, we compare
the result of kernel PCA with that of standard PCA, as shown on the
right of {numref}`fig:Kernel-PCA`. It is clear that kernel PCA leads to a
meaningful separation of the data while standard PCA completely fails.
