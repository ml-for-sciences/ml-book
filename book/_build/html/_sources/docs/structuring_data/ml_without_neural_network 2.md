# Structuring Data without Neural Networks


Deep learning with neural networks is very much at the forefront of the
recent renaissance in machine learning. However, machine learning is not
synonymous with neural networks. There is a wealth of machine learning
approaches without neural networks, and the boundary between them and
conventional statistical analysis is not always sharp.

It is a common misconception that neural network techniques would always
outperform these approaches. In fact, in some cases, a simple linear
method could achieve faster and better results. Even when we might
eventually want to use a deep network, simpler approaches may help to
understand the problem we are facing and the specificity of the data so
as to better formulate our machine learning strategy. In this chapter,
we shall explore machine learning approaches without the use of neural
networks. This will further allow us to introduce basic concepts and the
general form of a machine learning workflow.
