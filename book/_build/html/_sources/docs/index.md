# Machine Learning for Scientists

This is an introductory machine learning course specifically developed with STEM students in mind,
written by the theoretical [Condensed Matter Theory](https://www.physik.uzh.ch/en/groups/neupert.html) group at the University of Zurich and the [Quantum Matter and AI](https://twitter.com/QMAI_TUDelft) group at the Delft University of Technology. If you use the content of this webpage, please cite this arXiv:XX paper to acknowledge the work put into the development of this lecture.
