# Machine Learning for Scientists

This is an introductory machine learning course specifically developed with STEM students in mind,
written by [Condensed Matters](https://twitter.com/UZHMat) and [QMAI_TUDelft](https://twitter.com/QMAI_TUDelft).


```{note}
These lectures were built using the new Sphinx-based [Jupyter Book
2.0](https://beta.jupyterbook.org/intro.html) tool set, as part of the
[ExecutableBookProject](https://ebp.jupyterbook.org/en/latest/).
Instructions for how to build them from source can be found in the Jupyter
Book documentation.

Built based on [executable book example](https://github.com/executablebooks/quantecon-mini-example)
